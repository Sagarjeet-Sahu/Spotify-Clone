I created this web application. it is basically clone of Spotify. 
Build a Full Stack Spotify Clone with Next 13.4, React, Tailwind, Supabase, PostgreSQL, and Stripe. Using the power of Next.js 13 and React, i create a responsive and dynamic user interface that closely resembles Spotify's sleek design. Harnessing the flexibility of Tailwind CSS, you'll style your application with ease and achieve a visually stunning result. 
To handle the backend, i utilize Supabase, an open-source Firebase alternative built on top of PostgreSQL. Supabase project, create database schemas, and implement authentication, ensuring secure user registration and login processes. 
Additionally, i integrate Stripe, a leading payment processing platform, to enable premium subscriptions within your Spotify clone. Discover how to handle transactions, securely manage user billing information, and provide a seamless payment experience.
